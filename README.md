<h1>Product Dissection on OYO</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a comprehensive dissection of the product architecture of OYO, focusing on analyzing and mapping the relationships between different entities within the system. The database design is built using <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, and it includes various entities such as customers, bookings, hotels, rooms, payments, complaints/queries, and reviews.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Database Design</strong>: The project utilizes PostgreSQL to design and manage a relational database structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Entity Relationships</strong>: Key relationships between customers, bookings, hotels, rooms, payments, and reviews are mapped.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient Data Management</strong>: The database efficiently handles complex queries and relationships across multiple entities.</li>
